My First DRM tool :) This is discombobulator --- just load a .wav file and enter a number only tested with 00000000 so far, and it will use that to seed a scrambling of the audio. 
Click SCRAMBLE and save and it will save the "scrambled" wav file.    Then if you want to share that file with someone  just give them the number code to "unscramble it"
On the flip side load the scrambled audio file and input the number and choose descramble and save, and it will revert the audio back to its original form :)

So if you only want the intended person to hear the audio this is a way to "scramble" audio so no one but the person with the correct number or brute force method can descramble
it to hear the original audio - basically.  This is not a warranty that the audio is undescripherable without the code or Discombobulator.
